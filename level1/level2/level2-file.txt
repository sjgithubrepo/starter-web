Changes made to the forked repository can be merged with the original repository via a pull request. Pull request knocks the repository owner and tell that “I have made some changes, please merge these changes to your repository if you like it”. On the other hand, changes made on the local machine (cloned repository) can be pushed to the upstream repository directly. For this, the user must have the write access for the repository otherwise this is not possible. If the user does not have the write access, the only way to go is through the forked request. So in that case, the changes made in the cloned repository are first pushed to the forked repository and then a pull request is created. It is a better option to fork before clone if the user is not declared as a contributor and it is a third party repository (not of the organization).

Forking is a concept while cloning is a process. Forking is just containing a separate copy of the repository and there is no command involved. Cloning is done through the command ‘git clone‘ and it is a process of receiving all the code files to the local machine.
